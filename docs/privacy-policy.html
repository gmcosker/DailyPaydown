        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

        <p>Gray Studio ("we," "us," or "our") operates the DailyPaydown mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Account Information.</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and a securely hashed password. We never store your password in plain text.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial Data.</strong> When you connect a bank account through Plaid, we receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Credit card transaction names, amounts, dates, and pending status</li>
            <li>Checking account available and current balances</li>
            <li>Account names, types, and masked account numbers (last 4 digits only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not receive or store your bank login credentials. Plaid handles authentication directly with your financial institution.</p>

        <p><strong>Preferences.</strong> We store your selected timezone, daily notification time, and personal goal setting.</p>

        <p><strong>Device Information.</strong> If you enable push notifications, we store your Apple Push Notification service (APNs) device token to deliver daily spending summaries.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To calculate and display your daily credit card spending</li>
            <li>To send you a daily push notification with your spending summary at your chosen time</li>
            <li>To show your checking account balance alongside your spending</li>
            <li>To maintain a history of your daily spending reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal or financial data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p><strong>Plaid.</strong> We use <a href="https://plaid.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plaid Inc.</a> to connect to your financial institutions. When you connect your bank account, Plaid's own privacy policy applies to their handling of your data. You can review it at <a href="https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plaid.com/legal</a>.</p>

        <p>We do not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs in the App.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your financial access tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being stored in our database</li>
            <li>Passwords are hashed using bcrypt</li>
            <li>All communication between the App and our servers uses HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
            <li>Our servers are hosted on Fly.io with PostgreSQL database infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. Transaction data is synced on a rolling 30-day window. Daily spending reports are kept for your historical reference.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delete your account.</strong> You can permanently delete your account and all associated data at any time from Settings within the App. Deletion is immediate and irreversible.</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect your bank.</strong> You can disconnect your linked bank account from Settings at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Disable notifications.</strong> You can turn off push notifications through your device's Settings app or by adjusting notification preferences within the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by other means. The "Last updated" date at the top indicates when this policy was last revised.</p>
